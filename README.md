# data-structures
In this repository, the most commonly used data structures have been implemented from the scratch. The implementation language is Python 3 for now. In near future, I am planning to include C++ implementations too.

During the implementations, I followed the book, Introduction to Algorithms [1], written by Cormen et. al. I tried by best to explain what is going on with the code by including detailed comments.

Enjoy.
